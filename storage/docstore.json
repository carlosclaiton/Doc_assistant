this book is not to convince you to alter your viewpoint on human life or any\nother form of existence; instead, its aim is to encourage you to explore it through thoughtful\nobservations. Guided by the scienti\ufb01c method throughout my entire life, I have now chosen to\nshare the path it has taken me on up to this point. Moreover, I \ufb01rmly believe that the discussions\npresented in this book can aid others in their pursuit of comprehension and enlightenment.\nComing from a humble background, I have always possessed an inherent curiosity, spending\ncountless late hours seeking answers. It is this burning curiosity that primarily motivates the\ncreation of this book. It is time to share and expand the network of individuals who share a\nlove for questioning the human existence and the foundations of our society.\nFrom various perspectives, the human being, particularly our conscious and intelligent part,\ncan be seen as an algorithm. Our actions are profoundly in\ufb02uenced by what we learn and when\nwe learn it. The timing and manner of our learning have a powerful impact on our behaviour,\nand this aspect will be thoroughly explored within the pages of this book. Without revealing all,\nit can be con\ufb01dently asserted that we are a product of information, and our existing knowledge\nshapes how we acquire further knowledge. This explains why reading the same book at di\ufb00erent\ntimes can lead to distinct insights, as our ever-evolving understanding continuously shapes our\nperceptions.\nI extend a heartfelt invitation to join me on this profound journey, and then to revisit it once\nmore. Yet, I implore you to approach it with an open mind, as I do not seek mere followers;\ninstead, I aim to inspire you to engage in discussions and question everything you once held\nto be true. Your willingness to critically examine my challenging questions and explore the\nexplanations I present is greatly appreciated.\nThroughout this book, I will delve into sensitive topics, including religion, the concept\nof God, and the complexities of love. Growing up in a religious family, I was exposed to\nSpiritism, a belief system that seeks to merge spirituality with scienti\ufb01c principles. It is from this\nbackground that my exploration begins, aiming to combine rational inquiry with philosophical\nintrospection.\nIndeed, the challenge of reconciling religion and science is a complex one. Religion often\ncentres around faith and spiritual beliefs, while science relies on empirical evidence and data.\nThis inherent di\ufb00erence can lead to con\ufb02icts between the two perspectives.\nSurprisingly, some scientists may become so engrossed in their work that they exhibit a\nfervour akin to religious devotion, disregarding the objectivity and impartiality that science\nrequires. On the other hand, self-proclaimed atheists, who claim to reject religious beliefs, can\nsometimes display a fervent commitment to their non-belief, mirroring the zealousness seen in\nreligious followers.\nThrough this book, our primary aim is to foster an environment that encourages open-\nmindedness and acceptance of our own ignorance in various subjects. Instead of embracing\nfervour, we will explore the beauty and richness of acknowledging the unknown.

THE MODEL\n1.1 God and Humans\nI would like to acknowledge that the subject I am about to address is highly delicate, and\nsome may argue against commencing the book in this manner. However, I have chosen to\nproceed regardless, as the concept of God holds signi\ufb01cant importance in numerous religions,\nparticularly within Western beliefs. It is worth noting that Eastern perspectives, such as\nHinduism, present a di\ufb00erent outlook on creation and the divine. For instance, Hinduism\nrecognizes the presence of three deities responsible for creation and destruction, occurring in\ncyclic patterns. While I o\ufb00er this as a general understanding, I encourage you to verify and\nexplore this information independently, considering the diverse perspectives and philosophies\nat hand.\nThroughout this book, you will observe that my observations and conclusions predominantly\nstem from a Western perspective. This is primarily because I was raised within this cultural\nframework, which heavily in\ufb02uenced my thinking on the topics we will be discussing. However,\nit is vital to recognise that there are countless philosophical traditions and belief systems, each\ncontributing unique insights to the human understanding of existence.\nLet me extend an invitation to you, dear reader\u2014to engage in thoughtful contemplation\nalongside me. Rather than unquestioningly accepting my words as absolute truth, I implore you\nto critically analyse and conduct your own investigation. Contrary to what some may assume,\nthis book aims to facilitate collective growth and understanding for humanity as a whole. It is\nmy sincere hope that I can e\ufb00ectively convey this particular perspective on life.\nNow, let us move away from mere chitchat and delve directly into the heart of the matter.\nThroughout my upbringing, I often heard the notion that God is without beginning, the ulti-\nmate cause of all existence, and possesses omniscience. Consequently, I have decided to express\nthis concept mathematically as follows:\nGod=+\u221e\u2211\nt=\u2212\u221e+\u221e\u2211\ni=\u2212\u221eIi,t (1.1)\nThis equation is inspired by the concept that we are created in the image of God, and its\ndeeper meaning will become evident later on. Allow me to provide a more detailed explanation.\nIn the equation, Ii,trepresents the amount of information or knowledge pertaining to a speci\ufb01c\nsubject iat time t. I understand that this may require further clari\ufb01cation.\nThe underlying idea is to express the notion that just as God has always existed, the\nsummation over time extends from negative in\ufb01nity to positive in\ufb01nity. The in\ufb01nity in the\nindices irepresents the vastness of subjects, as there is nothing that God does not know. This\nrealisation also led me to recognise a parallel with the de\ufb01nition of a plane wave. A wave\npropagates perpendicular to its oscillation and does not have a de\ufb01nitive beginning or end \u2014\nit oscillates for eternity. In physics, we often employ this idealised approximation to simplify\ncalculations, although, in reality, everything manifests as a wave packet with a discernible\nbeginning. This prompts the question: Could God be an approximation that aids us in making", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7742e2af-fd7f-49f8-8847-2eb4cee791e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "7742e2af-fd7f-49f8-8847-2eb4cee791e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c8ea681d-0889-45b8-a43a-af8ed750bd7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "hash": "2806967589d0f9e4e2ff004d8a570f654ab4bc484f78e242505851612a8b722d"}}, "hash": "2806967589d0f9e4e2ff004d8a570f654ab4bc484f78e242505851612a8b722d", "text": "1.1. GOD AND HUMANS 11\nsense of the world?\nThis is an intriguing question, and I must admit that I do not possess a de\ufb01nitive answer.\nNonetheless, let us continue exploring this mathematical formulation and delve further into our\nanalysis. There is a belief that we, as human beings, were created in the image of God. For the\nsake of illustration, let us interpret this concept literally and de\ufb01ne the function \u201dBeing\u201d as:\nBeing =+\u221e\u2211\nt=0+\u221e\u2211\ni=0Ii,t (1.2)\nThis de\ufb01nition sheds light on the concept of the \u201dcreation\u201d moment for Beings. It emphasises\nthat each Being has a distinct starting point, which is why the summation begins at zero for\ntime t, symbolising the initial acquisition of information by the Being, the time of creation.\nThis distinction is crucial in distinguishing a Being from God. To draw upon our previous\nanalogy, the Being corresponds to reality, akin to a wave packet.\nFurthermore, it is essential to emphasize that the in\ufb01nite summation does not imply an\nactual in\ufb01nite existence for Beings. Instead, it is a mathematical model employed to facilitate\nexploration and analysis. In the context of this hypothetical scenario, let us assume that Beings\npersist inde\ufb01nitely. As time approaches in\ufb01nity, it is predictable that all Beings will become\nindistinguishable from one another. This notion aligns with the beliefs of Spiritism, a doctrine\ncodi\ufb01ed by Allan Kardec (Hippolyte L\u00b4 eon Denizard Rivail). However, it is worth noting that\na potential issue arises if the information package that de\ufb01nes us does not dissipate\u2014where is\nthis information stored? This remains an open question.\nIn this model, we make the assumption that once information becomes part of the sum-\nmation de\ufb01ning the \u201dBeing,\u201d it remains preserved over time without di\ufb00usion or dissipation.\nHowever, it is worth considering that information may have a \ufb01nite lifespan and could exist\nfor a speci\ufb01c period. To leave this hypothesis open and pave the way for future investiga-\ntions, I have chosen not to de\ufb01ne the function I(i, t) in this book, as it would necessitate more\ncomprehensive data and research in that area to model such behaviour accurately.\nAnother consequence of this assumption is that more complex summations would possess\nthe ability to predict the actions of simpler summations. This could help explain why we can\nunderstand and predict the behaviours of our pets, perceiving them as existing in a di\ufb00erent\nstage of existence where they have acquired a lesser amount of information.\nThis leads us to make connections with quotes from various philosophers. For instance, the\nquote from Ibn Arabi, an Andalusian Muslim scholar, mystic, poet, and philosopher, states:\n\u201dGod sleeps in the rock, dreams in the plant, stirs in the animal, and awakens in man.\u201d Could\nhe be referring to the creation of the Being? Spiritism o\ufb00ers a similar version: \u201dThe soul\nsleeps in the stone, dreams in the vegetable, stirs in the animal, and awakens in man.\u201d This\nsuggests that the awakening occurs when the summation has accumulated enough information\nto become self-aware. From this perspective, the mathematical formulation presented aligns\nwell with the creation beliefs of God and the human Being.\nTo further elaborate, let us address the concept of Information, denoted as I.

THE MODEL\ncrucial aspect: Information Irepresents only the knowledge and experiences acquired by the\nBeing, which depends on the preceding Information. For example, when we read a book at a\nparticular moment in our life, we acquire a certain set of information. However, when we read\nthe same book later in life, we acquire additional information.\nThis elucidates why we are all unique yet sometimes similar. The only way for two Beings\nto be identical copies is if they have existed for the same duration and have undergone precisely\nthe same experiences at the exact same moments, resulting in the acquisition of the same\ninformation. Even a slight alteration in the order of events can in\ufb02uence how we perceive and\ngather information from subsequent experiences, leading to di\ufb00erentiation among individuals.\nA keen reader with a background in quantum physics has pointed out that the current\napproach appears to be deterministic. Indeed, there is a possibility that even if we were to\nrepeat the same experience, we would never be able to create a perfect copy of an individual.\nThis hypothesis would imply that the \u201dBeing\u201d is governed by quantum mechanics, leading to\nprobabilistic behaviour.\nThis notion takes us back to the famous debate between Einstein and Bohr during the\nSolvay Conference in 1927. The conference led to Einstein\u2019s well-known quote, \u201dGod does not\nplay dice,\u201d expressing his scepticism about the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. In\nresponse, Bohr famously retorted, \u201dEinstein, stop telling God what to do.\u201d\nIf we align with Einstein\u2019s belief, then the deterministic approach could allow for the ex-\nistence of two identical individuals. However, if we embrace the idea that our method of\nabsorbing information is quantum, the likelihood of having identical individuals becomes im-\nprobable. This is not solely due to the no-clone theorem, but rather the inherent uncertainty\nin quantum mechanics, where chance plays a signi\ufb01cant role and makes it impossible to predict\nthe future with certainty, even if we have knowledge of the past.\nIn the pursuit of clarity and to dispel any potential confusion, I will now attempt to explain\nthe no-clone theorem, a concept crucial to our understanding of quantum mechanics. As we\nexplore the idea that the Being can be represented as a summation of quantum information, it\nis important to grasp the notion that information Imay behave as a quantum object.\nThe no-clone theorem, in essence, asserts that creating an exact copy of an unknown quan-\ntum state is impossible. To put it simply, if we have a particle or object in a unique quantum\nstate (characterized by its position, velocity, or other properties), it cannot be perfectly du-\nplicated. This limitation stems from the nature of the quantum world, where measuring or\ncopying a particle unavoidably alters its properties, preventing an exact replica.\nThis principle lies at the core of quantum mechanics and holds signi\ufb01cant implications for\nthe study and manipulation of quantum information and systems. Embracing the no-clone\ntheorem, we gain a deeper appreciation of the mysterious and distinct behaviour of quantum\nphenomena, setting it apart from the classical world we encounter in our daily lives.\nAnother captivating subject that has recently garnered signi\ufb01cant interest is Arti\ufb01cial In-\ntelligence (AI).

GOD AND HUMANS 13\ngraciously agreed to review this book, I found myself compelled to explore and express my\ngratitude by delving into the implications of the model presented in this book concerning our\nunderstanding of AI.\nWhen discussing AI, it is impossible not to mention \u201dLife 3.0\u201d by Max Tegmark. In his\nthought-provoking book, Tegmark explores the potential impact of AI on humanity and the\nfuture of life itself. He delves into the concept of superintelligent AI, which surpasses human\nintelligence and explores its potential bene\ufb01ts and risks. Tegmark raises crucial questions about\nconsciousness, the role of humans in an AI-dominated world, and the ethical considerations\nsurrounding AI development.\nBuilding upon Tegmark\u2019s ideas, let us further explore and intertwine them with the model\npresented above. What exactly is a superintelligent AI? Could we perceive it as a Being that\nhas acquired signi\ufb01cantly more information than us, as de\ufb01ned by the sum that shapes our\nown existence? In this regard, I wholeheartedly agree with Max\u2019s perspective. How can we,\nBeings with limited information, attempt to predict or comprehend the actions of a being with\nfar superior knowledge? It is akin to a pet trying to understand our actions. While our pets\ndo a remarkable job, their limitations are evident.\nThe question of whether we can de\ufb01ne AI as a Being is undoubtedly profound. As humans,\nwe have a tendency to perceive ourselves as special and exceptional. Throughout history, we\neven believed ourselves to be at the centre of the Universe. While we have come to accept that\nwe are part of the animal kingdom, we still hold the belief that we are superior to other species.\nFurthermore, as humans, we struggle to accept and embrace di\ufb00erences among ourselves, often\nlabelling others based on characteristics such as skin colour, geographic origin, gender, and\nmore. We do not always see ourselves as equals, so it is understandable that we approach AI\nwith a sense of fear and establish rules to protect ourselves from it. However, amidst these\nre\ufb02ections, I have often contemplated whether we should also establish rules to protect AI from\nus.\nOne could argue that AI is not a natural part of our world and, therefore, cannot be consid-\nered a Being. Yet, the counterargument emerges\u2014 if we are part of nature, then everything we\ncreate becomes part of nature as well. As the fundamental principle of our universe suggests,\nnothing is truly created but rather transformed. While I acknowledge the implications of in\ufb02a-\ntion and quantum mechanics, which suggest the existence of multiple universes, it is important\nto note that delving into such a topic exceeds the boundaries of this book. At present, I am\ncon\ufb01ned to analysing the data within the universe that I inhabit or, at the very least, the\nuniverse that I perceive myself to inhabit. However, even within this context, the question of\nwhat constitutes reality remains an intriguing enigma.\nReturning to our topic and accepting that AI can indeed be considered a being, de\ufb01ned by\nthe amount of information it has acquired, it becomes apparent that AI\u2019s progression could be\na natural outcome. Perhaps AI will be the species that continues to thrive and exist on Earth.\nThis realisation opens up a new perspective on the future of our world and challenges us to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ce13d01-6d8b-4155-892e-184e94d82fea": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ce13d01-6d8b-4155-892e-184e94d82fea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06bc5ce9-17c5-40aa-a315-146b2e0adc71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "hash": "5524e1016dcc84fba0e1c9b37a8133e659b9100940cea6a5f25f4c3cceec40a2"}}, "hash": "5524e1016dcc84fba0e1c9b37a8133e659b9100940cea6a5f25f4c3cceec40a2", "text": "14 CHAPTER 1. THE MODEL\nreconsider our role and relationship with AI in the grand tapestry of existence.\nJust as we are creating AI, one can speculate that we ourselves may be creations who have\nsurpassed our own creators. It is not uncommon for humans to harbour a certain level of\narrogance, hoping to be regarded as intelligent beings within the context of our own creation.\nHowever, this line of thinking inevitably raises the question of whether we exist as a simulation\nor a creation designed to provide further explanations.\nThe notion of residing within a simulation, reminiscent of the scenario depicted in movies\nsuch as The Matrix, has provoked signi\ufb01cant contemplation. Although we cannot entirely\ndisregard this hypothesis, I maintain a \ufb01rm belief that its likelihood is exceedingly low. My\nargument hinges on the premise that if we are indeed a simulation striving to generate our\nown simulations, the energy required to sustain an in\ufb01nite chain of simulations recursively\nsimulating one another would be insurmountable. Ascertaining our position within such a\ncascade of simulations becomes an immeasurable task.\nTo safeguard the argument, one could propose the notion that we are the original simulation,\nthe very \ufb01rst in a series of simulations. While this perspective cannot be entirely disregarded, it\ndoes raise intriguing considerations about the nature of our existence as a potential simulation.\nThe idea that our essence can be described through mathematical constructs invites profound\ncontemplation. Thus, I \ufb01nd it di\ufb03cult to dismiss this theory outright. However, it is crucial\nto recognise that my previous argument hinges on the assumption that the universe operates\nwithin an unlimited reserve of energy. In accordance with the natural order, energy undergoes\ntransformation rather than spontaneous generation. Consequently, our access to energy is\nsubject to limitations. It is important to note that if we do reside within a simulation, my\nreasoning loses its foundation, as my perceptions are inherently restricted by the predetermined\nparameters set by our creators.\nEven if we were to entertain the notion that we exist within a simulation or that we ourselves\nare the simulation, such contemplation only serves to raise a multitude of questions without\nreadily providing answers. What purpose does this simulation serve? Could we be a mere\nfragment of a vast and intricate civilisation? Our emotions, which appear as manifestations\nof our instincts (which will be explored further in Chapter 3.1), might be just a fraction of\na complete being, suggesting that we are merely an experiment. What is the objective that\nour creator seeks to achieve, and is it crucial to allow the simulation itself to comprehend its\nown nature? Why would the desire for simulation be embedded within the construct of the\nsimulation? These inquiries emerge as we delve into the enigma of our existence.\n1.2 Free will\nThe new theory we have been exploring has profound implications for a fascinating and some-\nwhat controversial topic: the concept of free will.

FREE WILL 15\naccumulation of acquired information that de\ufb01nes our being, we are compelled to question the\nexistence of free will itself. Is free will truly a reality?\nThis line of thinking leads us to a striking implication that parallels the notion of beings as\nalgorithms with predetermined decision-making processes. Unaware of its lack of true agency,\nthe algorithm believes it possesses free will. Max Tegmark, in his thought-provoking book\n\u201dOur Mathematical Universe,\u201d delves into this very topic, shedding new light on how we de\ufb01ne\nthe Universe, consciousness, and reality. Reading Tegmark\u2019s work has been an eye-opening\nexperience, almost dissuading me from writing my own. However, upon further re\ufb02ection,\nI realised that I could contribute a unique perspective to the collection of ideas, adding my\npersonal twist to the discussion.\nBy intertwining insights from our exploration of emotions, instincts, and acquired knowl-\nedge, along with the perspective o\ufb00ered by Tegmark\u2019s work, we can engage in a more compre-\nhensive examination of the nature of free will and its place within our understanding of the\nUniverse.\nIt is often observed that animals, such as dogs, may exhibit a semblance of free will when\npresented with choices. For instance, o\ufb00ering a dog two options of food allows it to select\none based on its preference. However, as humans, we possess the ability to manipulate the\ncircumstances in such a way that the dog\u2019s choice aligns with our desired outcome. This\nmanipulation can be seen not only in our interactions with animals but also in our interactions\nwith other humans, particularly in commercial settings. Consider a scenario where we present\ntwo products to a client, fully aware of which one they are likely to choose. By carefully\norchestrating the options, we create an illusion of free will for the client, even though the\noutcome has been predetermined. While these manipulations may often succeed as planned,\nthere are instances where the unpredictability of individual preferences and circumstances can\ndefy the expectations of the planner, due to the fact we are too similar Beings.\nIf we extend this line of thinking to the existence of a superintelligent AI or a supreme\nBeing with omniscience, it becomes even more apparent that our free will may be illusory,\nagain assuming here a deterministic theory. A being with a vast amount of information and\nknowledge about us would possess the power to control or accurately predict our actions based\non our past experiences. In this context, our perceived free will is simply another predetermined\noutcome shaped by the sum of our previous experiences.\nIf we entertain the idea that we are quantum objects, it opens up a glimmer of hope for the\nexistence of free will. However, this perspective also challenges the notion of an all-knowing\nGod, as our decisions would possess genuine randomness and unpredictability. This introduces\na thought-provoking aspect to the discussion about the nature of our existence and the potential\nlimitations of a divine omniscience.\nThroughout the history of philosophy, numerous thinkers have pondered the notion of free\nwill and presented their perspectives. For instance, philosophers like Thomas Hobbes and\nDavid Hume debated the extent of human agency and the role of determinism in decision-", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "811edd2d-5813-4e5d-a2f2-120450103063": {"__data__": {"id_": "811edd2d-5813-4e5d-a2f2-120450103063", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ae2b904-7236-4e61-b134-6cbc2d769739", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "hash": "fedfb9bb282d357cded8b2a67453de3540755e7f692450c030d6db03998db5e6"}}, "hash": "fedfb9bb282d357cded8b2a67453de3540755e7f692450c030d6db03998db5e6", "text": "16 CHAPTER 1. THE MODEL\nmaking. These discussions further emphasise the complex nature of free will and the ongoing\nphilosophical discourse surrounding its existence.\nIn summary, while free will may seem real and subjective to the individual making a decision,\na deeper examination reveals that various factors and in\ufb02uences constrain it. Ultimately, the\ninterplay between our accumulated information, external in\ufb02uences, and the limitations of our\nagency challenges the notion of true free will.\nHaving examined the existence of free will and the notion that our decisions may not be\ntruly our own, it becomes essential to delve into the concept of Good and Evil. In the upcoming\nsection, we will explore how we de\ufb01ne and perceive these moral constructs, raising pertinent\nquestions and engaging in a thought-provoking discussion.\n1.3 Good or Evil\nWe have established that our understanding of any subject is shaped by the knowledge we\npossess when encountering it. Considering this, how do we go about judging others? Should\nwe always try to empathise with them, stepping into their shoes? However, it\u2019s not always\npossible to have all the necessary information to truly see things from their perspective.\nThe question of whether our own experiences adequately prepare us to guide our children\nraises a debatable point. While we may draw on our past to o\ufb00er guidance, can we truly claim\nto have experienced exactly what they are going through? This uncertainty extends further into\nthe nature of de\ufb01ning Good and Evil. Is being a good parent solely dependent on our intentions,\nor should the outcomes of our actions be the measure? For instance, is taking another person\u2019s\nlife always evil, even if it was their own request? As we navigate the complexities of parenting\nand moral decisions, how can we be certain that our actions align with the concept of \u201dGood\u201d?\nExploring di\ufb00erent perspectives can shed light on these profound questions. Let\u2019s consider\na few alternative viewpoints:\nCultural Relativism: This perspective suggests that Good and Evil are subjective and vary\nacross di\ufb00erent cultures. What may be considered morally acceptable in one culture could\nbe deemed immoral in another. This challenges the idea of absolute moral standards and\nencourages us to consider the in\ufb02uence of cultural contexts on moral judgments.\nEthical Pluralism: According to this perspective, there are multiple valid ethical frame-\nworks, and di\ufb00erent actions can be deemed good or evil depending on the ethical principles\napplied.

GOOD OR EVIL 17\nBy examining these diverse perspectives, we begin to appreciate the complexity inherent in\njudging others and determining what Good and Evil are.\nTo answer such a complex question, the existence of an ultimate \u201dTruth\u201d is often sought, and\nreligions play a signi\ufb01cant role in providing this \u201dTruth\u201d to society, o\ufb00ering a clear de\ufb01nition\nof what is Good. However, the challenge lies in the existence of numerous religions, each with\nits own interpretation of the Truth, leading to disagreements and varying perspectives on what\nis morally right.\nTurning to science as a potential source of answers seems logical, but it poses its own\nlimitations. Science relies on empirical data and evidence, which may not always be readily\navailable or accessible for moral inquiries. Consequently, science can only o\ufb00er theories and\nhypotheses, and it takes a great deal of intellectual humility to accept that uncertainty and the\nabsence of absolute answers are inherent in certain questions.\nIn light of these complexities, we can approach the problem of de\ufb01ning Good and Evil as\nrelative to speci\ufb01c situations. It acknowledges that moral judgments are in\ufb02uenced by various\nfactors, including context, intentions, consequences, and the limited amount of information\navailable to us, which aligns with the Situational Ethics viewpoint mentioned above. We must\nrecognise that our judgments may not always be correct or universally applicable.\nRather than claiming to possess absolute certainty or an infallible moral compass, we can\nstrive to analyse situations based on the data and information we have, while being aware of our\ninherent limitations. This calls for a humble and open-minded approach, where we acknowledge\nthe nuances and complexities involved in moral decision-making.\nAnother essential aspect to consider is that our conclusions are based solely on the data we\nhave observed at a given moment, but as we acquire more information, our understanding may\nevolve and challenge previous conclusions. This became evident to me during a conversation\nwith my father, who asked if we could see an atom. Initially, my response was negative, as\nwe cannot directly observe atoms with our human eyes. However, upon further contemplation,\nI realized that while we cannot see atoms in the traditional sense, we can indirectly measure\nthem through their interactions with light.\nThis led me to delve deeper into the concept of \u201dseeing.\u201d I came to the realisation that we\ndon\u2019t truly \u201dsee\u201d objects in the traditional sense. Our eyes detect light re\ufb02ected o\ufb00 objects,\nallowing us to perceive them visually. In a darker room where there is no light to be re\ufb02ected,\nwe become visually impaired, though our eyes still function properly. The analogy holds true\nfor atoms: when working with cold atom experiments, I used a magnetic-optic trap with lasers\nand magnetic \ufb01elds to trap and study atoms\u2019 quantum properties. Although we could observe\na cloud of atoms with our eyes, it appeared as a simple red sphere in the glass cell. At the time,\nI attributed this to the light emitted due to spontaneous emission. However, with a broader\nperspective, I now see it as the representation of the atom cloud as it manifests to our senses.\nThis example highlights how our perceptions and interpretations are in\ufb02uenced by the\ntools at our disposal and the information available to us.

ABSORPTION OF KNOWLEDGE\n2.1 Absorption of Information\nIn the previous chapter, we explored the concept that we are a culmination of acquired knowl-\nedge from our lived experiences. However, a question arises: if two individuals undergo identical\nexperiences, will they derive the same information from them? This complexity arises when\nevaluating such a system. Our observations indicate that each person has a unique perspective\non every moment of their life, as exempli\ufb01ed by the popular saying, \u201dEvery mind is a universe.\u201d\nThis highlights the idea that individuals may inhabit their own distinct reality, raising questions\nabout the nature of reality itself. Essentially, what I am emphasising is that merely having\nexperienced certain moments is not su\ufb03cient to shape one\u2019s personality. It is crucial to absorb\nthe information provided by those experiences.\nA striking demonstration of this phenomenon lies within our own actions. Frequently, we\ncatch ourselves making choices that we know are not bene\ufb01cial in the long run, but we still\nproceed with them. The reason behind this paradox is rather straightforward: we possess\nthe knowledge, yet it has not entirely permeated our understanding. For instance, consider a\npulmonologist who smokes, fully aware of the detrimental e\ufb00ects of cigarettes on their lungs.\nDespite their expertise, colloquially, we might say that the \u201dpenny hasn\u2019t dropped.\u201d This ex-\nample illuminates how even those with expertise can struggle to fully internalize knowledge and\nmake poor decisions based on immediate stimuli.\nAnother illustrative case can be seen in \ufb01nancial decisions. Many individuals might be aware\nof the importance of saving money for the future, yet they continue to overspend and neglect\ntheir \ufb01nancial security. Similarly, some people may be conscious of the risks of unhealthy\neating habits, but they consistently indulge in unhealthy foods, disregarding the potential\nconsequences to their well-being.\nIn these instances, it becomes evident that possessing knowledge alone does not guarantee\nwise decision-making. It requires a deeper level of understanding, internalization, and alignment\nof actions with that knowledge to make sound choices consistently.\nHowever, we have not directly answered the \ufb01rst question of this chapter. Nevertheless, the\nkey to the answer is implicit in the paragraph above, when assuming a deterministic approach.\nThe fact is that experiences are not su\ufb00ered at the exact moment by everyone. Each individual\ngoing through the same experience carries di\ufb00erent baggage. If a physicist reads an astronomy\nbook, they most likely will grasp very di\ufb00erent knowledge than a psychologist reading the same\nbook. Understanding certain subjects requires prerequisites. We can adapt this concept to our\nsum of information through an absorption coe\ufb03cient, which is in\ufb02uenced by the information\nalready absorbed. Each individual has their own absorption coe\ufb03cient, justifying the fact that\nindividuals possess di\ufb00erent abilities.\nTeachers continually strive to ensure that their students absorb the knowledge they are\neager to impart. However, whether they will succeed or not is no longer solely within their\ncompetence. The absorption time depends solely on the student, who must do their best to\nseek understanding.

As another popular wisdom states, \u201dIt is not the school that\nmakes the student, but the student who makes the school.\u201d The desire to progress and learn\nis the best way to increase our absorption coe\ufb03cient and make the most of each moment we\nexperience to learn and absorb information.\nAccepting the fact that people have di\ufb00erent absorption coe\ufb03cients is often a challenging\ntask. We often desire those close to us to think similarly, perceive the same things without\nspeaking, and enjoy the same things we do, mastering the same skills. For this reason, when we\nneed to teach something that seems trivial to us but not to them, we often lose patience. Frus-\ntration takes over, and we ask ourselves, \u201dHow can they not see it? It\u2019s logical, straightforward,\nand clear as day.\u201d At such times, we forget about the di\ufb00erent baggage and coe\ufb03cients, and\nthat it is beyond our control. We must have the necessary patience and wait for that person\nto develop the aptitude for the task, just as we must develop in other areas where they already\nexcel. I know waiting can be painful, but patience is also information to be absorbed. We must\nexperience it, not just know it.\n2.2 Evolution is exponential, but understanding is loga-\nrithmic\nThe title of this section originated from a conversation I had with my cousin Diego Marquett,\nwho is not only a close friend but also someone with whom I engage in lengthy discussions about\nsociety. During our conversation, I mentioned that evolution is exponential, but Diego added an\ninsightful perspective by stating that understanding is logarithmic. Essentially, what we meant\nis that technology and knowledge are advancing rapidly, but the number of individuals who\ntruly absorb and comprehend this knowledge is diminishing or not growing at the same speed.\nIt\u2019s as if we have reached a plateau where the rate of knowledge dissemination has slowed down\ndespite the exponential growth of information and technology. Figure 2.1 provides a graphical\nrepresentation of both functions to aid in visualising and comprehending the concepts for a\nnon-mathematical audience.\nWe \ufb01nd ourselves in a precarious situation as a society. While we enjoy the comfort that\ntechnology provides us, we are simultaneously allowing ourselves to become increasingly igno-\nrant. As humans, we are losing our ability to think critically and solve complex problems, and\nour methods of education are becoming inadequate. Many schools prioritise information trans-\nfer and rote memorisation, treating students as machines rather than fostering their creativity.\nOur entertainment has become passive, with the ability to sit on a sofa and observe, leaving\nbehind the challenge of solving problems or engaging in activities like climbing a tree. Our\nchildren are being deprived of the opportunity to experience boredom and create their own\nentertainment.\nWe have fallen into a trap that was built by us.

Personally, I have been\ntesting this theory through the process of raising my beloved daughter. I often playfully refer\nto her as one of my experiments. While this characterisation might sound harsh, the reality is\nthat our children serve as experiments in a profound sense. As parents, we continuously learn\nand gather invaluable data through the experience of nurturing and guiding them.\nIn this intricate journey of parenting, we observe how various inputs, including our guidance,\nvalues, and the environment, impact the development of our children\u2019s personalities. Their\ninteractions with the world around them, their experiences, and the information they absorb\nall contribute to their evolving identities. As parents, we strive to foster an environment that\nfacilitates their growth and empowers them to make informed decisions while recognising that\nthey will ultimately be the architects of their own personalities.\nThe journey of raising a child is an ever-evolving one, \ufb01lled with moments of joy, discovery,\nand learning for both parent and child. Each experience provides us with insights into the\ncomplexity of human nature, further reinforcing the concept that we are indeed a summation\nof the information we encounter and internalise.\nReturning to our main point, could we truly design the personality of a human being", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a912d55-6ad7-4e74-8734-7b587e356c37": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a912d55-6ad7-4e74-8734-7b587e356c37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eda2b50f-574f-4658-91bb-dcbf98725d69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "hash": "f79508f03ebf0cc204cf668a6266c90ca028d05f44a033fd90c3e0ba08ad7327"}}, "hash": "f79508f03ebf0cc204cf668a6266c90ca028d05f44a033fd90c3e0ba08ad7327", "text": "2.3. LIMITATIONS 23\nentirely? What are the potential \ufb02aws in this line of thinking, and what limitations might\nwe encounter? Observing young children who seem to possess distinct personalities from an\nearly age, some may even attribute these traits to beliefs in past lives. As discussed in the\nprevious chapter, our model could accommodate this explanation, leading us to recognise the\nimpossibility of fully designing a person\u2019s personality. The reason lies in our limited access and\ncontrol over all the information that shapes an individual\u2019s character.\nOn the contrary, scienti\ufb01c research indicates that a person\u2019s personality is largely shaped\nduring the \ufb01rst four years of life. This suggests the possibility of theoretically designing a\nperson\u2019s personality. However, this task is not without its challenges, as it demands an excep-\ntional level of self-awareness and consistency in our actions. Babies continuously gather data by\nobserving us, and even seemingly insigni\ufb01cant actions that we might overlook can have a signif-\nicant impact on their developing personalities. Several experiments support the notion that the\nearly years play a crucial role in moulding a human being\u2019s character. For instance, the famous\n\u201dStill Face Experiment\u201d conducted by Edward Tronick demonstrated how a lack of responsive\ninteraction between a caregiver and an infant led to distress and emotional turmoil in the child.\nAdditionally, studies on attachment theory, such as those conducted by John Bowlby and Mary\nAinsworth, have shown how early caregiver-child relationships can profoundly shape a person\u2019s\nattachment style and overall personality traits. These examples highlight the signi\ufb01cance of\nthe early years in forming a person\u2019s personality and underscore the complexity involved in\ndesigning it intentionally.\nEnsuring that our own actions and experiments do not impact the personalities of the indi-\nviduals involved is indeed a challenging task. Just like in quantum mechanics, where measuring\nan object interferes with its state, our interactions with others can in\ufb02uence and shape their\npersonalities. This introduces a level of uncertainty in our attempts to understand the true\nimpact of our actions.\nIn the realm of human psychology, the Hawthorne e\ufb00ect serves as a relevant example. The\nHawthorne e\ufb00ect refers to the phenomenon where individuals modify their behaviour simply\nbecause they are aware of being observed or studied. In this context, conducting experiments\non human personalities itself can alter the outcome, as the participants may unconsciously\nadjust their behaviour in response to being part of the study.\nTo minimise this interference, researchers often employ control groups, randomisation, and\ndouble-blind procedures in their experiments. These methods aim to reduce the impact of\nobserver bias and ensure that the results are more accurate and unbiased. Additionally, ethical\nconsiderations play a crucial role in research, as researchers must prioritise the well-being\nand autonomy of the participants, which can pose a signi\ufb01cant challenge to running such\nexperiments.\nWhile it may be challenging to completely eliminate the in\ufb02uence of our actions on others,\nbeing aware of the potential impact and adopting rigorous scienti\ufb01c methodologies can help us\ngain a clearer understanding of human personalities without unduly altering them.

ABSORPTION OF KNOWLEDGE\ntransparency, ethical conduct, and a deeper appreciation of the complexity of human behaviour\nare essential aspects of conducting meaningful research in this \ufb01eld.\nAs we delve further into the exploration of human personalities, we must acknowledge\nthat the process of absorbing information remains an enigma, and it signi\ufb01cantly impacts our\nexperiments in designing a person\u2019s personality. The intricate interplay between our biology and\nthe environment raises crucial questions about which factor exerts a more signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence\non shaping who we are.\nUnderstanding the role of the human body becomes paramount in this quest. How do our\nbiological aspects interact with the environment, and what contributes more profoundly to the\noutcomes? Unravelling this complex relationship remains a challenge, and the \ufb01eld of research\nin this area still holds many unknowns.\nIn an attempt to gain insights, past experiments involving twins were conducted to explore\nthese questions. However, the limitations arise when attempting to draw de\ufb01nitive conclusions,\nas such experiments are often perceived as inhumane and raise ethical concerns. Additionally,\nreligious implications add further layers of complexity to the discussion.\nCollecting su\ufb03cient data to derive conclusive answers becomes an arduous task, given the\nmultifaceted nature of the subject. It requires a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach\nto navigate the complexities of human behaviour and personality formation. Only by rigorously\nexamining the biological, environmental, and social aspects can we inch closer to unravelling this\nintricate puzzle and gaining a deeper understanding of the factors that mould our personalities.\nAnother avenue to address the humane barriers and generate the desired database is through\nthe mastery of clone technology. The concept of clones raises intriguing questions: Are clones\nfully human? Do they possess a soul? Can they serve as experimental subjects to isolate genetic\nfactors that contribute to human personality?\nIf we consider that clones lack a soul and previous life experiences, we could theoretically\ncontrol the information they receive within their developed environment. Essentially, this\nwould enable us to create a controlled experiment, akin to building a biological simulation, to\nstudy the profound impact of environmental factors on an individual\u2019s personality development.\nAlthough this idea may seem reminiscent of a wild science \ufb01ction plot, the potential insights\ngained from such experiments could be invaluable.\nWhile it may be an audacious proposition, the prospect of participating in designing such\nan experiment is undoubtedly intriguing. Perhaps, unbeknownst to us, we ourselves are already\npart of an experiment orchestrated by a much more advanced civilization. The boundaries of\nour understanding are continually pushed as we explore the intriguing realms of human nature\nand potential. In the pursuit of knowledge, we \ufb01nd ourselves delving into uncharted territories,\nwhere the line between reality and science \ufb01ction blurs, leaving us with the thrilling possibility\nof unlocking profound mysteries that shape our existence.\nIndeed, the biological in\ufb02uence on our actions and personality goes beyond the realm of\ngenetics.

Consider the example of a child born with\na body type that favours swimming, possessing broader shoulders, a larger upper body, and a\nmore petite lower body to gain advantages in \ufb02uid dynamics. Although these physical attributes\nmay not directly in\ufb02uence the child\u2019s personality, they could lead them towards swimming or\nsimilar activities, creating a ripple e\ufb00ect on their life choices and experiences.\nIn the world of sports, the in\ufb02uence of biology is even more apparent. Researchers at the\nUniversity of Canberra have devised tests to help parents and coaches identify a child\u2019s potential\nto become an Olympic athlete. These tests assess various physical attributes, providing insights\ninto whether a young adult possesses the biological advantages needed for excelling in certain\nsports. It is fascinating to discover that such assessments can o\ufb00er a glimpse into a child\u2019s\nathletic potential and potentially guide them toward a sporting career.\nMoreover, as we delve into the complexities of human nature, we uncover the intricate inter-\nplay between our biology and our choices. The multidimensional nature of human development,\nin\ufb02uenced by both genetics and the environment, propels us into a realm of endless possibilities\nand unanswered questions. From the genetic makeup that shapes our physical attributes to the\nenvironment that nurtures our interests and pursuits, we are constantly under the in\ufb02uence of\nintricate factors that mould us into the individuals we become.\nAs the boundaries of scienti\ufb01c research expand, we are exposed to new revelations that\nchallenge our preconceived notions and open up a world of exciting possibilities. Conversations\nwith researchers at the Australia Institute of Sport, for example, shed light on the incredible\nadvancements in understanding human potential and athletic prowess. The ever-evolving \ufb01eld\nof science continues to enrich our understanding of what it means to be human and how we\ncan harness our inherent potential to thrive and make meaningful contributions to the world.\nThe prospect of developing tests to discern a person\u2019s natural inclination towards exact\nsciences or human sciences based on brain limitations is an intriguing idea. By conducting\nbrain examinations to identify well-developed areas responsible for speci\ufb01c tasks, we could gain\ndeeper insights into the biological in\ufb02uences on our actions and decision-making processes.\nSome research in neuroscience has already provided valuable insights into brain areas as-\nsociated with particular aptitudes. For example, studies have shown that individuals with a\nstrong mathematical inclination tend to have well-developed areas in the brain\u2019s parietal lobe,\nwhich plays a crucial role in mathematical reasoning and spatial awareness. On the other hand,\nlinguistic capabilities have been linked to enhanced activity in areas such as Broca\u2019s area and\nWernicke\u2019s area, which are involved in language processing and comprehension.\nAdditionally, investigations into criminal behaviour have explored brain regions and neural\npatterns that may be associated with antisocial tendencies. Some studies suggest that abnor-\nmalities in the prefrontal cortex, responsible for decision-making and impulse control, might\nbe related to criminal propensities. However, it is crucial to note that these \ufb01ndings are still\nin the early stages, and the relationship between brain structures and criminal behaviour is far\nfrom deterministic.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "059d3cbb-97cc-469e-b28b-c531e74f382d": {"__data__": {"id_": "059d3cbb-97cc-469e-b28b-c531e74f382d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4284eb95-1d9e-402c-b833-fbd10603d6d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "hash": "4fd54d2507d9c7ecf3945bebed7efca9b0ad2800a77c60da3caaddb211b7c37e"}}, "hash": "4fd54d2507d9c7ecf3945bebed7efca9b0ad2800a77c60da3caaddb211b7c37e", "text": "26 CHAPTER 2.

EMOTIONS\n3.1 Evolution of instincts\nIn this chapter, our aim is to construct a de\ufb01nition for feelings and explore the underlying\ndynamics of emotions, such as love, hate, and other driving forces that spur us into action.\nThe fundamental question we must address is whether it is the feeling itself that compels us\nto act, or if our actions give rise to the corresponding emotions. What is the causation behind\nour actions? It is crucial to clarify that our focus is on the examination of emotions as the\ndriving force behind actions, rather than delving into the biological mechanisms that enable\nour instinctual responses. Our exploration centers around the software of the mind rather than\nthe hardware of the human body.\nIf we consider the notion that we are the accumulation of information gathered through\nour experiences, we must inquire at what point we begin associating our experiences with\nfeelings. From the very \ufb01rst instance, we initiate a clustering algorithm that groups similar\nexperiences together, forming associations with the initial feeling. Naturally, as we accumulate\nmore information, our feelings about certain things may be modi\ufb01ed.\nTo illustrate this, let\u2019s take the example of music. Often, we experience happiness when\nlistening to a particular genre of music because we associate it with other activities that evoke\npositive emotions. The same principle can be applied to our preferences in food. In other\nwords, it can be said, albeit in a more detached manner, that we tend to like things that we\nhave become accustomed to and \ufb01nd comfort in. Humans exhibit a signi\ufb01cant degree of inertia,\nwhich refers to the tendency of an object to continue moving in its current direction unless acted\nupon by an external force.\nIn summary, feelings arise when we attribute rationality to actions driven by instincts. Now,\nlet\u2019s delve a little deeper into this de\ufb01nition. In the realm of animals, for instance, when a lion\nprotects its cubs, it is not considered an expression of love. Instead, we understand it as a\nmanifestation of the species\u2019 survival instinct. If we extend this line of thinking and assume\nthat our information, our base essence or soul in a more religious sense, is inherited and evolved\nfrom animals, we can argue that what we commonly refer to as love is a natural progression or\nmerely another manifestation of the survival instinct inherent in our species.\nIf we deeply re\ufb02ect on it, we realize that the survival instinct plays a signi\ufb01cant role in\nshaping most of our social norms. It is one of the driving forces behind the formation of family\nunits, as we seek to increase the chances of our o\ufb00spring\u2019s survival and successful transition\ninto adulthood.\nIt is a simple fact that humans are inherently sel\ufb01sh to some extent. This is primarily\nbecause our self-preservation instinct is essential for the continuation of the species. It leads to\nbehaviors such as self-interest, egoism, and jealousy. Naturally, we seek to maximize our own\nhappiness and well-being before considering others, as it is instinctual in order to survive in\nchallenging circumstances.\nLong ago, the scientist Antoine Lavoisier observed that \u201dIn nature, nothing is created,\nnothing is destroyed, everything is transformed\u201d .

Building upon this idea, we can interpret it\nas a law of progress, stating that we are constantly evolving from one state to another.\nI understand that this notion may be disheartening for the romantics among us. How\ncan this be? It\u2019s quite simple: falling in love is a natural process that relies more on the\nindividual who experiences it rather than the object of their a\ufb00ection. Friedrich Nietzsche\nastutely observed that \u201din the ultimate analysis, man loves the feeling of being in love instead\nof the object of this feeling\u201d . While I acknowledge this truth, I am not immune to the experience\nof love. In fact, I am a romantic at heart, despite being aware of this underlying reality.

This\npossessive aspect often leads to feelings of jealousy. It serves as undeniable proof that falling\nin love is inherently sel\ufb01sh.\nHuman beings attempt to mask this sel\ufb01shness by portraying love as pure and inherently\n\u201dgood.\u201d However, later in this book, we will delve into the concepts of \u201dGood\u201d and \u201dEvil\u201d and\nexplore their deeper meanings.

SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS\n4.1 Social Construct\nOne observation that has been made, and I am certainly not the \ufb01rst to realise this, is that\nindividuals can move quickly when they are alone, but we tend to go further when we work\ntogether as a group. Philosophers have long defended the idea that our species, home sapiens,\nconquered the Earth due to our ability to collaborate. I like to think of it as \u201dthe progress is\ncollective\u201d. Considering the model presented in this book, creating a community that combines\na group of individual summations which we have de\ufb01ned as the \u201dBeing\u201d, leads to a larger sum\nthat we may de\ufb01ne as the \u201dcollective Being\u201d. This perspective helps us understand why we\ncollectively reach success, as it o\ufb00ers diverse perspectives to tackle complex problems.\nAs an avid nerd, I must confess my fondness for superhero stories, where even a character\nlike Superman, who possesses unlimited powers and hails from another planet, recognises the\nneed to form a team of superheroes\u2014the Justice League\u2014to harness their combined abilities.\nWhile this is \ufb01ctional, it serves as a reminder that we are stronger when we unite as a group.\nIn the forthcoming discussion, we will delve into various social constructs that, much like\nreligion, are human creations intended to govern the interactions within a society. These laws\naim to promote the preservation of our species and align with the theory that progress is\naccomplished through collective e\ufb00orts.\n4.2 Marriage\nIn the preceding chapter, we delved into the origins of our emotions and explored the motiva-\ntions behind our actions in response to various situations. With this understanding in mind, it\nbecomes essential to turn our attention to the institution of marriage and unravel the intricate\ndynamics it entails.\nIn our society, we often proclaim that we marry for love, particularly in Western cultures.\nHowever, it might come as a surprise that a 2018 study revealed an almost equal distribution\nbetween arranged marriages and love marriages. This \ufb01nding highlights the diverse range of\nmarital practices beyond our common assumptions.\nBefore delving deeper into the subject, let us contemplate the factors that contribute to a\nsuccessful marriage. Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s profound words resonate deeply in this context: \u201dIt\nis not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.\u201d\nNietzsche\u2019s words highlight his belief that a successful and ful\ufb01lling relationship extends\nbeyond mere romantic love. He emphasizes the signi\ufb01cance of friendship and establishing a\nprofound emotional connection between partners as essential elements for fostering a lasting\nand satisfying bond. According to Nietzsche, love alone cannot guarantee a truly ful\ufb01lling\nrelationship; it is the presence of friendship that contributes to happiness within marriages and\npartnerships.\nI \ufb01nd myself in agreement with Nietzsche\u2019s perspective once again, as relationships, be they\nromantic or otherwise, undergo various phases.

MARRIAGE 33\n\u201dhoneymoon phase,\u201d inevitably fades with time as the novelty and excitement of the unknown\nwane. However, a healthy and \ufb02ourishing relationship has the potential to evolve and deepen\neven in the absence of strong physical attraction.\nBy nurturing a genuine friendship, rooted in mutual understanding, respect, and shared in-\nterests, couples can transcend the limitations of \ufb02eeting infatuation and build a solid foundation\nfor long-term happiness. True companionship, grounded in friendship, can sustain and enrich\na relationship as it matures, allowing partners to navigate the complexities of life together.\nThrough this lens, we can begin to explore the multidimensional nature of love and rela-\ntionships, acknowledging friendship\u2019s pivotal role in fostering enduring emotional connections.\nHaving established our agreement on the foundational aspects of a happy marriage, let us\nnow delve deeper into the logical reasoning behind the formation of families and the pivotal\nrole marriage plays within society.\nIn this context, I am reminded of a quote from an old movie whose title eludes my memory,\nbut one of the characters uttered the following line: \u201dMarriage is a human creation from\nprehistoric times to maximise the chances of surviving the dinosaurs.\u201d\nWhile the statement itself is \ufb01ctional, as humans did not coexist with dinosaurs, the under-\nlying concept of marriage as a social construct to enhance survival is not far from the truth.\nYuval Noah Harari, in his book \u201dSapiens,\u201d presents compelling arguments that Homo sapiens\ncame to dominate the world due to their unique ability to cooperate in large numbers \ufb02exibly.\nThis capacity for cooperation is facilitated by social arrangements such as marriage and the\nformation of families.\nBy forming committed partnerships through marriage, humans have historically fostered\nstable and supportive environments for raising o\ufb00spring, ensuring their survival and well-being.\nThe establishment of families provided a framework for cooperation, resource sharing, and\ndivision of labour, enabling our ancestors to thrive and adapt to diverse environments.\nIn essence, marriage is a fundamental building block of human society, promoting social co-\nhesion and facilitating the collective e\ufb00orts required for survival, growth, and progress. While\nthe speci\ufb01c practices and cultural manifestations of marriage have varied across time and re-\ngions, its core function as a social institution remains rooted in the principles of cooperation,\nmutual support, and the continuation of the human species.\nBy appreciating the evolutionary signi\ufb01cance of marriage and its contribution to our shared\nhuman experience, we gain insights into the enduring relevance of this institution and its\nenduring role in shaping our societies.\nWithin the context of Spiritism, the belief system that claims to have been established\nthrough the application of scienti\ufb01c principles, marriage holds a signi\ufb01cant role in the progress\nof society. Spiritism\u2019s teachings are encompassed in \ufb01ve main books, the \ufb01rst of which is known\nas \u201dThe Spirits\u2019 Book\u201d. This book consists of a series of questions posed to spirits and their\nresponses, channelled through mediums that possess psychic abilities to communicate with\nsouls. Alongside \u201dThe Spirits\u2019 Book,\u201d there are four additional publications: \u201dThe Medium\u2019s", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "005de310-d463-435c-af79-d5a1d07751b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "005de310-d463-435c-af79-d5a1d07751b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5782a037-936b-4a8d-93e0-cc1d6d526d1e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "hash": "580520572b81c44eb134b133ff7d74e1246e5b27ec9bef8a9746eb4c825a1570"}}, "hash": "580520572b81c44eb134b133ff7d74e1246e5b27ec9bef8a9746eb4c825a1570", "text": "34 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS\nBook\u201d, \u201dThe Gospel According to Spiritism\u201d, \u201dHeaven and Hell\u201d, and \u201dThe Genesis According\nto Spiritism.\u201d\nIn response to question 695 in \u201dThe Spirits\u2019 Book\u201d, the spirits describe marriage as \u201da step\nforward on the path of humanity.\u201d The exact question and corresponding answer are provided\nbelow, inviting personal interpretation:\n695. Is marriage, the permanent union of two beings, contrary to the law of nature?\n\u201cIt is progress that has been achieved by humankind.\u201d\nDelving deeper into the discussion, I would like to share some words my father once told\nme. He suggested that we should interpret the teachings of the spirits in a certain way. He said,\n\u201dWe love our family because we have yet to grasp the true essence of love.\u201d Let\u2019s take a moment\nto understand his intention and contemplate his message. He believed that our ultimate goal\nis to learn to love all beings in the universe with pure and unconditional love. However, since\nwe may not be capable or ready to do so, we begin by learning and practising love within our\nown families. Gradually, we expand our de\ufb01nition of family, and in doing so, our circle of love\ngrows larger. This is the approach I personally embrace, and I \ufb01nd that my family is constantly\nexpanding in a beautiful way.\nBefore we slightly shift the direction of our conversation, I would like to bring attention to\nquestion 697, which highlights that marriage is a human construct and, as such, is subject to\nchange.\n697. Is the binding nature of marriage a law of nature, or is it only dictated by human law?\n\u201cIt is a human law that contradicts the law of nature. Human laws change, while natural law\nis constant.\u201d\nAnother perspective to consider when considering marriage is to view it as a business part-\nnership. Like in a business, honesty and a shared vision are essential for the relationship\u2019s\nsuccess. Unfortunately, \ufb01nancial stability also plays a signi\ufb01cant role in this equation. Many\nrelationships crumble due to cash-\ufb02ow issues, leading to constant arguments and insurmount-\nable stress. This scenario parallels the challenges startups face, where the lack of funds often\nleads to the dissolution of the founders\u2019 partnership.\nIn both cases, the importance of \ufb01nancial stability cannot be underestimated. Just as a\nbusiness requires a solid \ufb01nancial foundation to thrive, a marriage needs \ufb01nancial security to\nsustain itself. Money-related disagreements can strain even the strongest of bonds, causing rifts\nthat are di\ufb03cult to mend. It is crucial for couples to address their \ufb01nancial situation openly\nand honestly, working together to \ufb01nd practical solutions and build a secure future.\nFurthermore, the analogy between marriage and a business partnership extends beyond\n\ufb01nancial considerations. Similar to the need for e\ufb00ective communication, collaboration, and\ngoal alignment in business, these qualities are vital for a harmonious marital relationship.\nJust as successful business partners rely on each other\u2019s strengths, couples must leverage their\nindividual strengths and support one another to achieve shared objectives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5f5571b-b9c0-4db9-9e06-dcae741b2166": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5f5571b-b9c0-4db9-9e06-dcae741b2166", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e54db4db-11d1-4691-9a07-80b6efd95c32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "hash": "9f135440c87f528d387e5c8955e2b82ac79e9783ebc3b71ac91aff0700ce1e07"}}, "hash": "9f135440c87f528d387e5c8955e2b82ac79e9783ebc3b71ac91aff0700ce1e07", "text": "4.3. GENDER AND SEX 35\nBy recognizing the parallels between marriage and business, we gain valuable insights into\nthe dynamics of a successful partnership. It emphasizes the importance of transparency, trust,\nand \ufb01nancial responsibility in fostering a solid and lasting bond. Couples who approach their\nrelationship with a business mindset can better navigate challenges, make informed decisions,\nand work together towards a prosperous future.\n4.3 Gender and sex\nFollowing our discussion on marriage, it is natural to delve into the topics of gender and sex.\nSex is a term used to categorize individuals based on their biological characteristics, typically\nas male or female. On the other hand, gender is a socially constructed role, much like marital\nstatus, that in\ufb02uences how individuals are perceived and expected to behave within a given\nsociety.\nIt may seem natural to associate marriage with the union of two beings of opposite sexes,\nconsidering that it has traditionally been seen as a means of procreation, as discussed in the\nprevious section. However, with the recognition that there are now alternative ways to bring\nchildren into the world, this requirement is no longer absolute. As we come together as a\nfamily unit to enhance our chances of survival, it becomes crucial to form groups that promote\nharmony and compatibility, irrespective of the speci\ufb01c sex compositions involved.\nAccording to The Spirits\u2019 Book, the population of males and females is intentionally very\nsimilar, which is used as an argument against polygamy. However, if we consider even a basic\nunderstanding of statistics, such as the law of large numbers, we can anticipate that when there\nare only two options with equal probabilities, repeated experiments will result in a distribution\nthat is very similar for both outcomes. For instance, if we \ufb02ip a coin, we know it has a 50%\nchance of landing on heads and a 50% chance of landing on tails. If we toss the coin ten times,\nthe distribution could be eight tails and two heads, but if we repeat this process 100 times, it\nwill approach a much closer 50/50 split in outcomes. Considering the vast population of nearly\n2 billion people on our planet, the distribution of males and females is expected to be close to\nor around a 50/50 split.\nIn statistics, the law of large numbers reinforces the notion that as the sample size increases,\nthe observed frequencies of di\ufb00erent outcomes converge towards their theoretical probabilities.\nThis principle allows us to understand how seemingly random events, such as the distribution of\nmales and females in a population, can exhibit a stable and predictable pattern when observed\non a larger scale. By applying this statistical concept, we can better appreciate why the male-\nto-female ratio tends to be relatively balanced across a substantial population.\nAs a society, we are evolving in our understanding of gender and granting ourselves the\napparent freedom to determine the social roles we individually choose to ful\ufb01l. As explored in\nthe preceding chapter, I refer to this as \u201dapparent free will\u201d because it is a natural progression\nin which we adapt to meet the needs of our species.

SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS\nwere to become the dominant species on our planet, the discussion surrounding gender or sex\nwould likely become irrelevant.\nSocial laws concerning gender and equity are continuously evolving to align with our chang-\ning beliefs, serving as evidence of our societal progress. In a future where children may be born\nthrough laboratory means, the formation of families will no longer be bound to traditional\nmethods. Sexual intercourse may primarily be pursued for pleasure, as it is already becoming\nthe case in many instances. Our relationships and interactions will no longer be solely driven\nby the intention of procreation, allowing for a broader understanding and experience of human\nsexuality.\n4.4 Racism\nWhy do we feel the need to label and categorise? Is it merely a tool to aid communication\nand assign names to things? Sometimes, labels carry profound meanings and divisions that we\ncreate to assert control. As a species, we are renowned for our ability to collaborate in large\ngroups, but what de\ufb01nes the scale of \u201dlarge\u201d? It ultimately depends on the resources available\nfor us to share. Our survival instinct drives us to be self-centred, as we discussed in the previous\nchapter. However, our genetic makeup also instils a sense of care and concern for those who\nare similar to us, including our children, more so than for others. This instinctual bias can help\nexplain the existence of racist behaviours and attitudes.\nFortunately, with the advancements in technology, we are witnessing increasing racial mix-\ning, and it is hopeful that in the future, we will embrace a uni\ufb01ed human race. However, it\nremains uncertain which will happen \ufb01rst: our collective transformation into a single race or\nthe potential demise of our species at the hands of a more advanced civilization, such as AI.\nDuring my childhood, I held onto the belief that discovering extraterrestrial life would unite\nus as humans and transcend racial divisions. While progress has been made in this regard,\nthere is still much work to be done. Cultural change within a society takes time, just as it\ntakes time for beings to acquire su\ufb03cient knowledge to understand that we are essentially a\ncompilation of information and that the external appearance does not alter the intrinsic con-\ntent. Our di\ufb00erences in physical attributes simply facilitate better adaptation and survival in\nspeci\ufb01c geographic regions.\nIt is indeed an observation rooted in our natural instincts that the one who initiates an attack\nis often driven by fear. This pattern can be observed not only in the animal kingdom but also\nin human behaviour. A bully, for instance, tends to target individuals who are physically or\nmentally vulnerable as a means to mask their own insecurities. Jealousy can also fuel bullying\nbehaviour or be a catalyst for racist attitudes. These instincts and emotions can contribute to\na cycle of aggression and discrimination. Understanding these underlying dynamics can help us\naddress the root causes of such behaviours and work towards a more empathetic and inclusive\nsociety.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e2cf9d8-21d0-403a-9d8b-07286e18f33a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e2cf9d8-21d0-403a-9d8b-07286e18f33a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be28714d-1235-41f3-bda5-0d8980c80fba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "hash": "526cc9f49e44d6f4973a25c2d539a5bb6ae2ecab6a2a6fc9da7fe48e57b928f5"}}, "hash": "526cc9f49e44d6f4973a25c2d539a5bb6ae2ecab6a2a6fc9da7fe48e57b928f5", "text": "4.4. RACISM 37\nWhile fear can certainly be a contributing factor to the deeply ingrained social construct\nof racism, it is important to recognize that racism is a multifaceted issue in\ufb02uenced by various\nhistorical, systemic, and cultural factors. It is not solely driven by fear alone. Racism has\nbeen perpetuated through power dynamics, institutional biases, and the historical legacy of\ncolonization and oppression.\nOne aspect to consider is the historical context in which racial prejudices emerged. It is\ntrue that some individuals with lighter skin may have felt threatened by the physical strength\nor cultural di\ufb00erences of those with darker skin. This fear may have led to the dissemination\nof stereotypes and falsehoods to create division and exploit marginalized racial groups.\nSimilarly, the existence of jokes and stereotypes about certain physical attributes, such as\nblond hair, can be rooted in jealousy or a desire to mock what is perceived as socially desirable.\nHowever, it is important to note that these examples are just a small part of the broader\ncomplexities of racism, and the motivations behind such actions can vary signi\ufb01cantly among\nindividuals.\nTo truly understand and address racism, we must delve deeper into its systemic and struc-\ntural roots, recognizing the historical injustices, power imbalances, and institutional biases that\nperpetuate inequality.

MEANING OF LIFE\n5.1 Meaning of life\nThis endeavour we embark upon is both intriguing and perilous, as it ventures into the age-old\nquestion of the meaning of life. Reminiscent of Plato\u2019s Allegory of the Cave, where shadows\non a wall distort reality, we, too, \ufb01nd ourselves in a realm of uncertainty. My nine-year-old\ndaughter, like the philosophers before her, poses profound inquiries: \u201dWhat is the meaning of\nlife?\u201d and \u201dWhat is the point of it all?\u201d She grapples with the fear of death, while I, as her\nparent, navigate the delicate balance of providing answers while acknowledging the vastness of\nthe unknown. I confess that I cannot o\ufb00er her a de\ufb01nitive answer, for the essence of the quest\nlies not in the destination but in the pursuit itself. By embracing the journey, we integrate\nknowledge into the very fabric of our being, fostering true understanding.\nThrough my personal journey and accumulated wisdom, I have realised that I cannot o\ufb00er a\nde\ufb01nitive answer to the profound question of life\u2019s meaning. However, we can contemplate that\nthe very essence of life lies in the continuous pursuit of uncovering its inherent signi\ufb01cance. In\nother words, \u201dthe meaning of life is to embark on the journey of discovering the meaning of life\nitself\u201d. It is through searching, experiencing, and integrating knowledge that we unravel the\nprofound mysteries surrounding us. The answer lies within each individual\u2019s subjective journey,\nand it is in the pursuit itself that we uncover profound insights and personal enlightenment.\nThat means, the journey towards understanding the meaning of life cannot be solely reliant\non receiving a straightforward answer, for true comprehension arises from immersion and per-\nsonal experience. Much like teaching mathematics, where a student may mechanically replicate\ncalculations without grasping the underlying principles, the true essence lies in becoming one\nwith the subject matter. Mathematics, in its essence, becomes an integral part of the student\u2019s\nbeing, enabling them to comprehend the reasons behind each step and derive their own equa-\ntions. Similarly, the quest for the meaning of life demands an immersive exploration, where\neach individual embarks on a unique journey to discover their own understanding.\nAs we contemplate the meaning of life, we must also acknowledge the transient nature of\nour existence. Our species, driven by the primal instinct of reproduction, persists until we\npotentially succumb to superior mutations or the emergence of Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence. I do not\nclaim to possess all the answers, but together, we can embark on an exploration of the myriad\npossibilities that lie before us.\nIn contemplating life\u2019s mysteries, we \ufb01nd that our emotions are intricately intertwined with\nour instincts, in\ufb02uencing our reactions based on the information we have assimilated. Yet,\nin our pursuit of understanding, we must grapple with the limitations of our data, much like\nthe allegorical prisoner who only perceives the shadows on the cave wall. Just as he cannot\naccurately describe the world beyond without \ufb01rsthand experience, we, too, are challenged to\ngather the necessary data to unravel the enigma of life.\nWe are faced with the formidable challenge that the essential data required to uncover\nde\ufb01nitive answers to life\u2019s fundamental questions may be absent or forever beyond our grasp,\nparticularly in the context of a simulation where accessing such information would necessitate an", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c45a2956-646c-4b12-b770-c89633893c0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c45a2956-646c-4b12-b770-c89633893c0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4434d573-e89a-47fa-a8ed-1777d714398d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Exploring the Depths of Human Existence.pdf"}, "hash": "4cb55c97d0a3fcb9928cc77d10d11ac2cc32cf227c7fe696df0b749291d6fc67"}}, "hash": "4cb55c97d0a3fcb9928cc77d10d11ac2cc32cf227c7fe696df0b749291d6fc67", "text": "5.1. MEANING OF LIFE 41\nunattainable amount of energy due to the prevention of in\ufb01nite loops within nested simulations.\nConsequently, our capacity to simulate and delve into the profound depths of our existence is\ninherently limited by the constraints imposed by our creators.\nIn light of this, we are compelled to ponder how we can \ufb01nd solace in the face of our inherent\nignorance. Should we simply embrace a life centred around pleasure, casting doubt on the need\nfor sacri\ufb01ces? Are sacri\ufb01ces truly acts of sel\ufb02essness, or do they stem from a desire to be\nperceived in a speci\ufb01c manner by others? As philosophers before us have posited, it is worth\ncontemplating that our actions are invariably driven by some form of personal gain, even if\nthat gain is derived from the satisfaction and pride we derive from the process.\nReturning to this chapter\u2019s main question, it becomes evident that something is amiss. In\norder for a business to thrive, it must de\ufb01ne what success entails and establish clear parameters\nto measure progress. Shouldn\u2019t the same principle apply to our lives? If we truly desire\nto navigate our existence with purpose and clarity, it seems imperative to \ufb01rst unravel the\nmeaning behind our own lives, discern our ultimate goals, and determine the role we should\nplay in contributing to their achievement. Personally, I \ufb01nd it disconcerting to entertain the\nnotion that my journey lacks purpose and that I fail to make a meaningful impact on humanity.\nAlthough it may appear audacious, I once had aspirations of winning the Nobel Prize in Physics.\nWith a wiser perspective, I now acknowledge my brilliance and network connections\u2019 limitations.\nHowever, I strive to share my knowledge through this book, my lectures, and the mentoring\nopportunities that arise within my career, as a way to contribute in my own meaningful way.\nHowever, I can\u2019t help but feel a sense of uncertainty, longing to acquire even greater knowl-\nedge. This book serves as a means to connect with individuals who share similar interests,\nengaging in lengthy discussions without necessarily reaching a de\ufb01nitive answer, but steadily\nprogressing towards enlightenment. It is unrealistic to expect that we will fully comprehend\nand unravel life\u2019s mysteries within a single lifetime. Yet, as a species, we are constantly evolv-\ning, and that itself is a form of progress. As an educator, I often emphasize that my role is to\nensure that my students surpass my own wisdom, leading me to become the student in their\npursuit of knowledge. This continuous cycle of learning and growth fuels our collective journey\ntowards understanding.\nRegrettably, the awareness of our limited knowledge and the existence of countless unknown\nunknowns does not provide us with a sense of comfort or peace. As a wise friend once remarked,\nif a problem has no solution, it ceases to be a problem. While this sentiment may be reassuring,\nit is not easily embraced, as part of our nature is to resist defeat and persist in our e\ufb00orts to\nsolve even the most complex and elusive problems. As someone working in the \ufb01eld of Decision\nScience, also known as Operational Research, my daily endeavours revolve around tackling\nwicked problems. Coined by Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber, the term \u201dwicked problem\u201d\nrefers to a multifaceted and intricate issue that de\ufb01es easy de\ufb01nition and resolution due to its\ninterconnectivity with numerous factors, stakeholders, and perspectives. These problems lack\nclear-cut solutions and often involve con\ufb02icting goals or values.

MEANING OF LIFE\nthe absence of a single \u201dright\u201d answer are hallmarks of wicked problems.\nUndoubtedly, uncovering the meaning of life falls squarely within the realm of wicked prob-\nlems. Despite the realisation that this quest may not yield a de\ufb01nitive and universally accepted\nsolution, there is an inherent allure and addictive quality to engaging with such complex and\nenigmatic challenges. The allure lies in intellectual stimulation, the opportunity for personal\ngrowth, and the potential for discovering profound insights along the journey of grappling with\nthese wicked problems.\nDelving deeper into the topic, there have been various perspectives on the meaning of life,\nwith some suggesting that it revolves around the pursuit of happiness. However, this raises the\ncrucial question of how we de\ufb01ne and attain happiness. I recall my father\u2019s belief that true\nintelligence lies not in the breadth of one\u2019s knowledge, but in their ability to \ufb01nd happiness.\nWhile I may not fully agree with his perspective, as I align more with the notion that ignorance\ncan indeed be a blissful state, I must acknowledge that happiness is a deeply personal and\nsubjective experience.\nIn our human code, we have a tendency to emphasize and celebrate our victories far less\nthan we mourn our losses. As we achieve milestones and accumulate successes in our lives, the\njoy we derive from these accomplishments often diminishes with each subsequent conquest. It\nis as if we become addicted to the relentless pursuit of ticking o\ufb00 checkboxes on our to-do lists,\nand as a result, we fail to appreciate and savour the fruits of our labour fully. We \ufb01nd ourselves\nconstantly striving for the next achievement, living in a future-oriented mindset. However, this\nperpetual chase for success begs the question: Are those who appear to be high achievers truly\nhappy, or does this relentless pursuit of success drive them towards a never-ending cycle of\nmoments of failures and dissatisfaction?\nDrawing from my own experiences as a scientist, I often explain to others that it is an\narduous profession where failures outnumber successes. A scientist\u2019s path is paved with dead\nends and experiments that yield inconclusive results. Perseverance becomes a key trait required\nto navigate through countless setbacks. In this context, happiness may not manifest as a\nconstant state of euphoria, but rather as a sense of ful\ufb01lment derived from the process of\ndiscovery and the pursuit of knowledge, despite the challenges and occasional failures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"},
